	Fundamentals of Linux ::::
	
		Introduction to Linux!
		
			Operating System!:
			
				-> It is an interface between the user Applications and Underlying Hardware.
				
					Eg.: Windows/Mac/Linux 
			
	Linux Operating System 
	
		- Open-Source 
		- Is Secured 
		- Linux OS was created based on the Unix Operating System 
		- Is an interface between the user applications and underlying Hardware.
		- Linux OS is based on the Command User Interface
		- Core of Linux OS is called kernel!
				The kernel is the main part of the operating system that directly interacts 					with the hardware and controls everything in the system.
			Components of Linux OS Architecture
				- Networking 
				- Storage 
				- IPC - Inter Process Communication
				- User Management 
				- Security Management 
				- Control Groups 
				- Namespace 
				- Process 
			
		- Command Line Interface 
	
		- Linux Distributions :::
		
			- Flavors of Linux OS 
			
				- Centos / RHEL 
				- Debian / Ubuntu 
				- Fedora	
Ubuntu is a ready-to-use Operating System built on top of the Linux kernel.
Linux (kernel)  → Engine
Ubuntu (Linux distribution) → Full car with engine, body, seats, controls, etc.
Ubuntu is a Linux-based operating system that uses the Linux kernel and provides a complete, easy-to-use system for desktops, servers, and cloud environments.

	- Remote Servers Management :::	

		VM1 
		
		VM2 
		
		Environments :
		
			Dev Environment (VM1)
			
			Build Environment --> Application Build ==> *.war 
			 
			QA (VM1) *.war 
			
			UAT (VM1) *.war 
			
			Prod (VM1) *.war 

Use Case :

		1. Establish Connection to Remote Server  
		2. Login to the Remote Server 
		3. Copy the Files from one server to another server
			using SCP
		4. Manage the Remote Server - Install any package/Uninstall/Upgrade 
		
		Pre-requisites for Remote Server :::
		
			- Launch 2 VMs (VM1-Source & VM2-Target)
			
			- Ensure that Port 22 is enabled 
			
			- Create User in both the VMs 
			
			- Create SSH-Key in one server(VM1)
					ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521
					
			- Use the public_Key as a authorized_keys in the target server(VM2)
			
			- Establish SSH Connection & Login to VM2(Target_Machine)
			
			- Copy Files from VM1 to VM2(Target_Machine)
	
	
		-> Authentication : Tells who can access the Server 	
		
		-> Authorization : Tells what can be done on that Server


		Target_Server --> 

			- Create User in both the VMs ::::
			
				useradd adminuser -s /bin/bash -m -d /home/adminuser

				su - adminuser					

			- Use the public_Key as a authorized_keys in the target server(VM2) :::

				mkdir .ssh 

				cd .ssh 


				vi authorized_keys

				#paste the id_ecdsa.pub of devopsadmin user from Server machine to authorized_keys file in Client Machine 

				chmod 600 /home/adminuser/.ssh/*


			- Establish SSH Connection & Login to VM2(Target_Machine)

					ssh adminuser@172.31.35.84 			# Using Private IP Address

					exit 								# To Close Connection
			
			- Copy Files from VM1 to VM2(Target_Machine)
			

				#cp  /home/devopsadmin/sourcefile.txt home/devopsadmin/dir1/
		
				 scp /home/devopsadmin2/sourcefile.txt adminuser@172.31.35.84:/home/adminuser
				 
				 
				 Web Application Server in Target Machine :
				 
					Tomcat / Nginx 
				 
				
				Source_Server 										Target_Server using Tomcat
																		
					*.war 													/opt/tomcat/webapps
			
					scp /home/devopsadmin2/*.war		adminuser@172.31.35.84:/opt/tomcat/webapps
					
				
			- Change the Ownership :
			
				chown -R adminuser:adminuser /opt/tomcat/
				
				chown -R adminuser:adminuser /root/dir1
			
			
			- Copy Directories to Target Server ::
			
				 scp -r /home/devopsadmin2/sampledir1 adminuser@172.31.35.84:/home/adminuser


		To Add Any User to a Group :
		
			usermod -aG <group_name> <user_name>
			
			usermod -aG docker devopsadmin2

	
	- Process Automation(Shell Scripting) :::
	
	
		Fundamentals of Shell Scripts on DevOps Perspectives :::
			
		
			Scripting Languages ?
				- Are used to perform some process automation/validations
				- Light-weight 
				- Eg.: java scripts / shell scripts / yaml script / groovy / python 
					(vs)
			Progamming Language ?
				- Are used to create some business applications 
				- Huge Collection of Programming components
				- Eg.: Java/.Net Framework/Python/Ruby/Cobol/C
		
		
	Shell Scripting Language :
	
		- Shell Scripting is a collection shell commands 
		- Shell Script file should be saved as *.sh (Extention should be .sh)
		
	Install git ?
	
		Install all these packages in 200 VMs :::
	
		apt install openjdk11 -y
		apt install git -y 
		apt install maven -y 
		apt install docker.io -y
		apt install ansible -y 	
	
	vi Build_Server_Config.sh
	
		apt install openjdk11 -y
		apt install git -y 
		apt install maven -y 
		apt install docker.io -y
		apt install ansible -y	
	
	Build Environment Server (VM):	To Perform Application Build - Identify the Source Code,Compile,Create Artifacts(Binaries)
	
		- Install all the required build tools : 1 Build Server ==> 50 Build Server!
		
				- apt install git -y  
				- apt install jdk -y 
				- apt install maven -y 			# Build Tool 
				- apt install docker.io -y 		# To Containerize Application
				
				
			vi javamaven-buildconfig.sh
			
				sudo apt install git -y  
	            sudo apt install jdk -y 
	            sudo apt install maven -y 		
                sudo apt install docker.io -y 	
				
				
			Test Servers :::
			
			
				- testing tools - TestNG / Selenium / jdk / docker
				
				
			Periodic Server Management :::
			
			
				- Clean-up 
				
					rm dir!
					
					
					
			Periodic Backup of Files/Directories


				#!/bin/bash
				sudo apt install git -y 
				sudo apt install openjdk11 -y
				sudo apt install maven -y 
				sudo apt install docker.io -y
				#sudo apt install ansible -y 

				save the script as installbuildtools.sh 

				/home/devopsadmin/scripts/$ ls 
				installbuildtools.sh	

				/home/devopsadmin/scripts/$ ./installbuildtools.sh		# Run the Shell Script!	




#########################
Day 7 : 4th Sep. 2025
#########################	

	Continue with shell scripting!
	
	Building blocks to develop and script or program ?
	
	1. Understand the requirement! 
	
	2. Choose Scripting Languages!
	


	Why we need Scripting / Programming Langauges ????
	
		Applications / Packages 
		
	IT Service!
	
		Data!
		
		What is Data ?
		
			- Is a raw text/content - without any meaning!
			
			- Eg.: 
			
					India 
						
		
		Is an Information ?
		
		What is Information ?
		
			- Is a Processed Data. 
			
			- The Processed Data becomes Information
			
					India is a Country 

		
		
		How to Handle/Process the Data! 
		
			- Programming/Scripting Langauges
			
			
		Variables :
		
			x = 5;
			
			y = 5;
			
			z = 0;
			
			a = "hello"
			
			
			b = "Team"
			
			To Perform any Arithmetic Operations we need Numerica data!
			
			z = x + y 
			
			c = a + y 
			
			
		Data Types :
		
			int x = 5;
			
			x = "Hello" 
			
			
			String a = "Hello"
			
			char x = 'A'
			
			boolean z = True/False 
			
			
		
			Sting Stud_Name = "Student1"
			
			Array ::
			
			String Stud_Name[5] = {"xxx","yyy","zzz","aaa","bbb"}
									0	  1		2	  3		4
								

			In Array Variabe, data can be identified using unique index
			
			
				print Stud_Name[0] ==> "xxx"
			
				print "aaa" ==> Stud_Name[3]
				
				
			Looping Constructs ::
			
				- To iterate / repeat any process to handle the data :
			
				- for loop 
				
				- while loop 
				
			Conditional Statements :
			
				- To validate the Data:
				
				Stud_name :: "xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
				
				Stud_name :: "12312313123"
				
				Stud_EMail :: "xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
				
				Stud_EMail :: "xxxxxxxxxxxxx@gmail.com"	

				
				
			IF Statements 
			
				if Stud_name is Numeric 
				
				if a > b 
				
				if b > c 
			
			Switch Case Statements 
			
			Manage/Store data in the Permanent storage:
			
				File Operations : Create/Read/Write/Update/Delete 
				
				Sequential --> 
				
				Only Sequential Search is possible 
				
				
			Relational Database Management System - RDBMS 
			
				Tables/Columns 
				
				
				Stud_Info - Table :
				
				Stud_ID 	Stud_Name 		Email_ID			Address		Mobile 		Course_ID 
					
				1001		xxxxxxxxxxxxx	xxx@asdf.com		zzz			9999999999	CID101
			
				1002		2342342342324	xxx@asdf.com		zzz			asdfasdf	CID101
				
		
			Script/Program to interact with external Services 
			
				- Remote Servers! 
				
				- Services 
				
					--> API Call to access remote services!
					
							- using *.json / *.yaml files 	- based on the key-value pairs
			
				
			
			Functions ::
			
				- Are used to maintain some set of instructions that can be performed very frequently.
				
				- Define a function and invoke it any number times 
				
				- Reusablity 
			
			
	chmod 755 config-build-tools.sh
	
				save the script as installbuildtools.sh 

				/home/devopsadmin/scripts/$ ls 
				installbuildtools.sh	
				
				chmod 755 installbuildtools.sh
